# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Applying machine learning in predicticting credit risk

## Overview of analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to implement machine learning techniques in solving credit card risk problems. Methods such as over- and undersampling are employed along with scikit and other  libraries in Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Predicting credit risk can assist banks and financial institutions foresee anomalies, reduce risk cases, provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud. The analysis also evaluates the performance of the machine learning models to provide direction on whether they should be used to predit credit risk.

## Summary
Based on the results obtained from each analysis, the model I would recommend for predicting credit risk would be the . The reason for this is
